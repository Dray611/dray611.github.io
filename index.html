            <h2> My Journey From Soldier to Information Systems Professional </h2>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my first static website! This website was the first coding project I worked on in my python class at LSU. I used Atom to write and edit my HTML code and then deployed my code to my GitHub repository. Coding my website from scratch was one of the most rewarding experiences because I got to learn about the front end and back end of web development. Although my website is static and quite simple, I am proud to share my work with you.</p>



<p> I spent my first 18 years living and growing up in the beautiful state of Colorado. After graduating high school in 2017, I enlisted into the Army as an I.T. Specialist. I spent 3 months challenging myself both mentally and physically at basic training in South Carolina. After basic training I moved to Augusta, Georgia to study information technology for the Army. While I was in AIT (Advanced Individual Training), I gained a lot of knowledge and skills in computer networking, software troubleshooting, planning, designing, and testing computer systems. For my capstone project I had to work within a team to build a network from scratch. We had to make ethernet cables, configure our own routers and switches, and install and maintain software to ensure the clients were able to communicate via email. After completion of AIT I moved to New Mexico to pursue an officer role in the military. I studied Business Administration at the New Mexico Military Institute (NMMI) and graduated with highest honors. I also earned my commission through the ROTC program at NMMI. After commissioning as an officer, I moved to Louisiana to further my education and military career. I’m currently studying Information Systems and Decision Sciences at Louisiana State University. .</p>



<p>Outside of school I’m a platoon leader for a signal company in the Army National Guard. As a platoon leader I manage and mentor subordinate enlisted soldiers, supervise and execute training requirements, manage all communication functions supporting the company, and develop training schedules. I love what I do because I get to foster the health, welfare, training, and professional development of my soldiers. The military has taught me a lot of valuable skills such as time management, leadership development, teamwork, and discipline. </p>

<p>After I graduate college, I plan on moving back to Colorado to start my career in the information systems field. I hope to one day work as a business analyst, information system analyst, or information security analyst within a highly motivated and diverse team.
